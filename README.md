# Kings County Housing Bake-off
---
This project conducts an analysis on the Seattle, Washington, Kings County Houses attributes data to create a model that will make the best prediction of the price of a house. House prices depend on a lot of factors like the house characteristics, economic environment, housing market, neighborhood, neighboring houses, proximity to amenities etc. According to an article on [Opendoor](https://www.opendoor.com/w/blog/factors-that-influence-home-value) the depending variables can be boiled down to eight critical factors; neighborhood comps, location, home size and usable space, age and condition, upgrades and updates, local market, economic indicators and interest rates.The project will use intuition, statistics and python to build the model.


# Data
The data used in this project is based on the following 21 key descriptions of houses sold in Kings County of Seattle, Washington.

* **id** - unique ID for a house
* **date** - Date day house was sold
* **price** - Price is the prediction target
* **bedrooms** - Number of bedrooms
* **bathrooms** - Number of bathrooms
* **sqft_living** - square footage of the home
* **sqft_lot** - square footage of the lot
* **floors** - Total floors (levels) in house
* **waterfront** - Whether house has a view to a waterfront
* **view** - Number of times house has been viewed
* **condition** - How good the condition is (overall)
* **grade** - overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
* **sqft_above** - square footage of house (apart from basement)
* **sqft_basement** - square footage of the basement
* **yr_built** - Year when house was built
* **yr_renovated** - Year when house was renovated
* **zipcode** - zip code in which house is located
* **lat** - Latitude coordinate
* **long** - Longitude coordinate
* **sqft_living15** - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
* **sqft_lot15** - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors

The training dataset on which the model will be built has information on 17290 houses in the Kings County.
